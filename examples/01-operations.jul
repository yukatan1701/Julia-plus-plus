# Here's the comment!
# Use 'println' to print value with a line break
# or 'print' to print without it.
# Also you can use 'space' to put " " character and
# 'newline' to add a line break manually.

a = 7 + 3
b = (a + 2) * 8
println b
a = (a / 2) % 2
println a

d = 2 - 1
d = d << 4
println d

println 1 ^ 0
x = y = 15 & 2
r = 2 | 4
println x

# yes, it's an increment and a decrement.

println ++y
